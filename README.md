## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their theme preference saved in the browser, with the theme being loaded upon the page being loaded.

### Screenshot

![Final Screenshots](images/FyloDarkScreenShots/Desktop.png)

This is a screenshot for a laptop size screen, 1440 * 900. I had issues setting up the background curvy image on different screens but I eventually came up with this.

### What challenged me!
I realized, I have a lot to learn about pseudo elements and the **background images **
### What I learned

I got deeper into the background images, their sizing as well as their positioning. I still have a long way to go but am really happy with the progress.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Definately **THE** most valuable tool in a web developers **TOOLBOX**, frontend or backend. Any search engine would do, though.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This is one of my go-to platform. It is full of articles that are clearly and broadly explained by people with vast knowledge of CSS.
- [Florin Poppin | Form Validation](https://codepen.io/FlorinPop17/pen/OJ...) -This codepen corresponding this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsd4FNGTRBw) came in handy for the form validation with JavaScript.
- [Stack Overflow | email Regex](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/201323/how-to-validate-an-email-address-using-a-regular-expression) - This is always vital for a reminder of regular expressions
- [Stack Overflow | email Regex](http://emailregex.com/) - I also used the JavaScript regex on this page for tests.
